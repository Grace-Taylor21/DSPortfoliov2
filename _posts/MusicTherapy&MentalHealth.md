The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. Initial steps included the removal of null and invalid entries and the anonymisation of patient details to ensure privacy. 
My approach includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, supported by visualisations to examine correlations.

Key steps:
- Data preprocessing (handling nulls, encoding, scaling)
- Feature selection using correlation and K Means Clustering
